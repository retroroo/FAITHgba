# FaithGBA
 Faith recreation in GB Studio for the game boy advance


# I want to playtest!
See releases tab for .rom files. Sameboy or other accurate hardware emulator is recommended.

If you want to playtest on GBA hardware, you can compile a .gb to a catridge or flash cart for your own GBA.



# I want to contribute
Follow one of the GB Studio tutorials that are available. Once downloaded, simply clone the repo and begin. 

GB studio is a pretty high level engine and should allow anyone to easily be able to make changes. 
If you make a helpful change, please create a pull request and I will review and submit the changes.


# That seems hard, how else can I help?
There are support links in my profile. Im known for procrastinating, and knowing a game is wanted motivates me. Sharing this project on social media would also help.

Many thanks
